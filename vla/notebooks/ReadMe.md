## Notebooks

This folder contains all prototype Jupyter notebooks used during the development of the perception pipeline. These notebooks include early experiments, visualization tools, model exploration, data preprocessing trials, and proof-of-concept implementations that guided the final system design.

They serve as a reference for understanding the experimentation process, iterative improvements, and key decisions made throughout the perception pipeline’s creation.
