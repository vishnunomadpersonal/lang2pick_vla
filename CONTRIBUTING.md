### Getting started

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. Create a topic branch for your change. Keep each branch focused on a single logical change.
3. Make changes in small, well-scoped commits.

Example (assuming a typical ROS2 workspace):

```bash
# from repo root
git checkout -b feat/short-description
# make changes
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(component): short description"
git push origin feat/short-description
```

If your change includes code that needs building or tests run in ROS2, we recommend building with `colcon` in the `ros2_ws` workspace and running tests locally before opening a PR.

### Code of Conduct

Be respectful and welcoming. If you don't already have a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` in the repo, assume standard contributor-friendly behavior: be civil, inclusive, and constructive. If you believe a contributor violated the code of conduct, contact a repository maintainer.

### Reporting bugs

When filing an issue, include:

- A clear, descriptive title
- A short summary of the problem
- Steps to reproduce (minimal reproduction preferred)
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, ROS2 distro, commit/branch, hardware if relevant)
- Any logs, stack traces, or screenshots

Good issue reports help us fix bugs faster.

### Requesting features

Open an issue describing the use-case, suggested design, and any alternatives you considered. Label it as `feature` if the repository uses labels.

### Working on code (branches & commits)

Branch naming convention:
	- feat/<short-description> for new features
	- fix/<short-description> for bug fixes
	- docs/<short-description> for documentation only
	- test/<short-description> for tests

- One logical change per branch/PR.
- Keep commits small and focused. Rebase to keep history tidy if requested by maintainers.

Commit message guidelines (recommendation):

- Use Conventional Commits style: `<type>(scope): short description`
	- Examples: `feat(motion): add trajectory smoothing`, `fix(driver): handle timeout`
- Keep the subject line <= 72 characters. Add a longer body if needed explaining the why and how.

### Creating a pull request

When ready, open a pull request from your branch to `main` (or the branch specified in the issue). In the PR description, include:

- Which issue the PR fixes or implements (use `Fixes #<issue>` when appropriate)
- Summary of changes
- Any setup or build steps for reviewers
- Testing done (unit/integration/manual)

PR checklist (please ensure before requesting review):

- [ ] The PR has a clear title and description
- [ ] Related issue referenced (if applicable)
- [ ] Tests added/updated for new behavior
- [ ] Documentation updated (README, code comments, configs)
- [ ] Code builds and tests pass locally
- [ ] CI checks are green

### Review process & CI

We use automated CI to run linters and tests. A PR requires at least one approving review from a maintainer before merge.

Maintainers may request changes; please respond to review comments and update the PR. Squash or rebase as requested.

### Style & testing

Try to match the repository's existing style. Common recommendations:

- C++: follow the project's clang-format/ament settings and ROS2 C++ style
- Python: follow Black and Flake8 conventions

Run these common commands when relevant (example):

```bash
# build a ROS2 workspace
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash

# run tests
colcon test --packages-select <package_name>
colcon test-result --verbose
```

If you add new functionality, include or update unit tests where possible.

### Licensing and copyright

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under this repository's license (see `LICENSE`). When in doubt, keep changes minimal and discuss large contributions in an issue first.

### Thank you

Thanks for helping make this project better! We appreciate every contribution :) large or small.
